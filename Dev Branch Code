# Define the variables
# Number_of_Customers: Number of customers served in a month
# Menu_Price: Average price of items on the menu
# Marketing_Spend: Amount spent on marketing in a month
# Average_Customer_Spending: Average spending per customer
# Promotions: Number of promotional activities carried out
# Reviews: Number of reviews received
# Monthly_Revenue: Total revenue generated in a month

# Create a dictionary with the given variables
